Building skills, one project at a time.

## Description

The "learnc" project is my personal learning journey, where I focus on improving my skills in the C programming language and expanding my knowledge through hands-on projects. This repository serves as a space to document my progress, track my learning journey, and showcase the code I develop along the way.

## Project Goals

- Improve skills in the C programming language
- Expand knowledge through hands-on projects
- Document progress and learning journey
- Showcase code developed during the process
- Foster a growth mindset and continuous learning


## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `exercises/`: Contains practice exercises to reinforce concepts.
- `projects/`: Holds small projects that demonstrate practical application.
- `docs/`: Provides additional documentation or notes related to the learning process.
